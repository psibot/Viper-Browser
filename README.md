```console 
sudo apt install qtwebengine5-dev libqt5x11extras5-dev libqt5webchannel5-dev
sudo apt-get install qtdeclarative5-dev
sudo apt install libkf5wallet-dev libsqlite3-dev tor* proxychains
$ git clone https://github.com/LeFroid/Viper-Browser.git viper-browser
$ mkdir -p viper-browser/build && cd viper-browser/build
$ cmake ..
$ make

Tests can be ran by setting the `ENABLE_TESTING` in the cmake configuration.
